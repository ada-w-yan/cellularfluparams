# cellularfluparams
Perform analyses and make plots for *Cellular reproduction number, generation time and growth rate differ between human- and avian-adapted influenza strains*


## Installation
Installation should be straightforward, though there are two dependencies on non-CRAN packages which can be found here: 

[`odin`](https://github.com/mrc-ide/odin)
[`lazymcmc`](https://github.com/ada-w-yan/lazymcmc)

To install the package itself, simply type the following:
```r
devtools::install_github("ada-w-yan/lazymcmc") % install dependencies
devtools::install_github("mrc-ide/odin") % install dependencies
devtools::install_github("ada-w-yan/cellularfluparams")
```
